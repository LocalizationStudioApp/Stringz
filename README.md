✏️ Description
</h2>

Stringz greatly simplifies localizing your Xcode apps (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) by introducing a powerful editor for all localizable files in your project.
It even imports strings from storyboard and xib files saving you a lot of time and effort finding and matching elementIds in your storyboards.
Stringz also supports localizing your Info.plist file so you can easily translate your app name and permission descriptions.

Stringz will also highlight missing translations and warn you about duplicate values and has many more useful features that take a painful and tedious task like localizing your app and convert it to an easy and simple task.

<h2 id='section_installation'>
⬇️ Installation
</h2>

- From [releases](https://github.com/mohakapt/Stringz/releases) page of this repository.
- Via Homebrew ```brew install --cask stringz```


<h2 id='section_usage'>
🔌 Usage
</h2>

Open the application and select your Xcode project (.xcodeproj) in the open dialog, Stringz will then automatically crawl your project, find localizable files, and display them in the sidebar. Select a localizable file from the sidebar to view its contents. From there you can add/delete/update strings and add new languages.

Stringz also supports Undo/Redo feature so you don't have to worry about making mistakes while working just hit Ctrl+Z to take your last action back.

The application has an autosave feature so it will automatically save your changes as you make them (You can also disable this feature from preferences if you don't want Xcode to reload every time you update a string).

The preferences window also contains some useful options regarding importing and exporting localizable files to your project. So I would strongly advise you to check app preferences out.

There is a sample app included in this repository, Stringz was heavily tested with this sample app, So I encourage you to download the sample app and run Stringz on it to examine how Stringz should normally work, If you encounter an unexpected behavior with your own project please consider submitting an [issue](https://github.com/mohakapt/Stringz/issues) and I'll make sure to fix it as quickly as possible.
